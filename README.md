# SmartWiki

SmartWiki is a simple and powerful wiki application built with Go. It features a user-friendly interface with a WYSIWYG
editor for easy content creation and editing.

## Essential Features (WIP)

SmartWiki is in active development and doesn't provide all features for the minimum viable product yet.

- Page CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete wiki pages.
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
- WYSIWYG Editor: Rich text editor for easy content creation and editing.
- Search Functionality: Advanced search using vector embeddings for accurate results.
- Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly interface for accessibility on various devices.
- Clean architecture: Easy maintainability.

### Vector Embeddings for Advanced Searching

Vector embeddings are a powerful technique that transforms data such as text, files, and images into high-dimensional
vectors, allowing for sophisticated and nuanced searching capabilities. By representing data in this way, it becomes
possible to perform more accurate and meaningful searches that go beyond simple keyword matching, capturing the
underlying semantics of the content. In SmartWiki, we leverage vector embeddings to enhance search functionality,
enabling users to find relevant information quickly and efficiently.

Currently, our implementation supports SQLite and
OpenAI as AI endpoints, providing robust and scalable solutions for embedding and searching.
Thanks to our clean architecture, integrating additional AI endpoints or extending existing functionality to support
other types of data, such as images, can be done with minimal effort, making SmartWiki a flexible and future-proof
platform.

## Important Features for the future

- Version Control: Track changes and allow rollback to previous versions of pages.
- User Roles and Permissions: Manage access control with different user roles.
- Tagging and Categorization: Organize pages with tags and categories for easier navigation.
- Comments and Discussions: Enable users to comment on and discuss wiki pages.
- File and Image Uploads: Allow users to upload and embed files and images in pages.
